# vscode-messages README

A project built for ichack2022 by Pranav Bansal, Akshat Tripathi, Krishan Sritharar, Nasir Majid and Henry Hu. vscode-messages works as a virtual tap on the shoulder and sends messages with neatly referenced code if you have any questions to any of the developers that have worked on that code. It gets the information from source control and integrates with Cisco Webex to send messages.
