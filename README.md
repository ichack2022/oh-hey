# Oh Hey!

Oh Hey is a VS Code extension which is meant to make asking quick questions about code easier, especially in a hybrid work environment. It's first release is available under the name [vscode-messages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ichack2022-16.vscode-messages) in the Vs Code extension Marketplace. 

A project built for ichack2022 by [Pranav Bansal](https://github.com/prnvbn), [Akshat Tripathi](https://github.com/Akshat-Tripathi), [Krishan Sritharar](https://github.com/KrishanSritharar2000), [Nasir Majid](https://github.com/nasirmajid29) and [Henry Hu](https://github.com/HenryHu2000). vscode-messages works as a virtual tap on the shoulder and sends messages with neatly referenced code if you have any questions to any of the developers that have worked on that code. It gets the information from source control and integrates with Cisco Webex to send messages.
